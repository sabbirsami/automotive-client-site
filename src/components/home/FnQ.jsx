                                        It matters simply because this is the
                                        amount you will have to pay to buy the
                                        car. This cost consists of the car
                                        price, along with the price of any
                                        accessories you have opted for,
                                        registration, insurance, extended
                                        warranty (if opted for) and handling
                                        charges. It may also involve other taxes
                                        and charges for an essential kit that
                                        dealerships offer with every new car.
                                        These costs, when added up, may just
                                        push the car out of your budget. So, do
                                        ask this question at the earliest.{" "}

                                        Almost every manufacturer covers the
                                        mechanical and electrical components in
                                        the warranty. But do check whether
                                        accessories like stereo that are
                                        installed by the dealer are covered
                                        under warranty too. Also, do ask about
                                        the intervals at which the car needs to
                                        be serviced and for a rough estimate of
                                        the cost of each service. This will help
                                        you understand whether the vehicle is
                                        maintenance-heavy or not.{" "}

                                        A lot of dealerships also double as
                                        service centres. However, in some cases,
                                        the dealership is separate from the
                                        service centre. In such a case, you
                                        should ask for the nearest service
                                        centre. This will help you gauge how far
                                        you need to take your car to get a
                                        problem fixed. Also, do ask if the car
                                        can be picked up and dropped by the
                                        service centre guys at your doorstep.
                                        The answer will tell you whether you
                                        need to drop your car for service every
                                        time or whether someone can pick it up
                                        from your house and drop it while you
                                        get on with your daily chores.{" "}

                                        Sometimes, dealerships have to resort to
                                        selling demo cars due to a shortage of
                                        supply from the manufacturer. These
                                        cars, usually kept in mint condition,
                                        may suffer from issues ranging from
                                        exterior damage to mechanical issues. Do
                                        ask this question to avoid buying a used
                                        car for the price of a new car. As an
                                        added precaution, you should also give
                                        your new car a thorough look for any
                                        issues and take it for a short spin too.{" "}

                                        Sometimes, the carmakerâ€™s manufacturing
                                        facility is quite close to the
                                        dealership. In such a case, unless the
                                        waiting period of the car&#39;s is long,
                                        chances are that you will get your car
                                        almost instantaneously. Sometimes, the
                                        dealership has the same car already in
                                        stock for you. Asking this question will
                                        help you understand whether the dealer
                                        has your car (in the color of your
